# AF-GAN-Attentional-Fusion-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-Text-to-Image-Synthesis-with-EmojiSet
In this project, we build our own EmojiSet and propose a novel attentional fusion generative adversarial network (AF-GAN) for text-to-image synthesis. AF-GAN outperforms the model used in the previous emoji generation work and can produce more virtually identical eomjis.
